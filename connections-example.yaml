# UserConfigDir returns the default root directory to use
# for user-specific configuration data.
# Users should create their own application-specific
# subdirectory within this one and use that.

# On Unix systems, it returns $XDG_CONFIG_HOME as specified by
# https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html
# if non-empty, else $HOME/.config.
# On Darwin, it returns $HOME/Library/Application Support.
# On Windows, it returns %AppData%. On Plan 9, it returns $home/lib.
